# Camel Openshift Console Plugin


This project provides a [console plugin](https://github.com/openshift/console/tree/master/frontend/packages/console-dynamic-plugin-sdk) for [Camel](https://camel.apache.org).
The project is created using [openshift console plugin template](https://github.com/openshift/console-plugin-template)

**Current version: 0.2.0**

It requires:
* OpenShift 4.19
* [Camel Dashboard Operator](https://github.com/squakez/camel-dashboard-operator)


It can also leverage the [Hawtio Online OpenShift Console Plugin](https://github.com/hawtio/hawtio-online-console-plugin).

# Local Development

Node.js 20+ and Yarn are required to build and run this locally. To run OpenShift console in a container, [podman 3.2.0+](https://podman.io) or [Docker](https://www.docker.com) is required.

For development you can login to an existing [OpenShift](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift) and run the console with the plugin included locally.

In one terminal window, run:

1. `yarn install`
2. `yarn run start`

In another terminal window, run:

1. `oc login` (requires [oc](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/downloads) and an [OpenShift cluster](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/create))
2. `yarn run start-console` (requires [Docker](https://www.docker.com) or [podman 3.2.0+](https://podman.io))

This will run the OpenShift console in a container connected to the cluster
you've logged into. The plugin HTTP server runs on port 9001 with CORS enabled.
Navigate to <http://localhost:9000/example> to see the running plugin.

# Deployment to OpenShift

To deploy the console plugin to an actual [OpenShift](https://www.redhat.com/en/technologies/cloud-computing/openshift) cluster the following are needed:

- [oc](https://console.redhat.com/openshift/downloads)
- [helm](https://helm.sh)

### Building the images locally

```sh
podman build -t quay.io/camel-tooling/camel-openshift-console-plugin:latest .
podman push quay.io/camel-tooling/camel-openshift-console-plugin:latest
```

**Note**: The image `quay.io/camel-tooling/camel-openshift-console-plugin:latest` is published so it can be pulled instead.

### Deploying the plugin using Helm

```sh
oc new-project camel-dashboard
helm upgrade -i camel-openshift-console-plugin https://github.com/camel-tooling/camel-openshift-console-plugin/raw/refs/heads/main/docs/charts/camel-openshift-console-plugin-0.2.0.tgz --namespace camel-dashboard --set plugin.image=quay.io/camel-tooling/camel-openshift-console-plugin:latest
```

## User Configuration

To be able to see your Camel integrations in the Camel Dashboard you need for your user to have access to the Custom Resources created by the camel-dashboard-operator with the following permissions:

```yaml
- apiGroups:
  - "camel.apache.org"
  resources:
  - camelapps
  verbs:
  - get
  - list
  - watch
```

You can use the helm script installation with the your values to easily create `Role`/`RoleBinding` pairs: 
```yaml
camelAppRbac:
  - namespace: my-project
    subjects:
      - apiGroup: rbac.authorization.k8s.io
        kind: User
        name: developer
```
